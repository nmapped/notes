_Deep Questions with Cal Newport: Manage Your Time in 5 Minutes a Day,_

Criteria for a good time management system:
1. Requires no more than 5-10 minutes of effort in a single 24 hour period.
2. Doesn't force an unchangeable minute-by-minute schedule on your day.
3. Helps you remember, plan, and complete important tasks before the very last moment.
4. Can quickly be restarted after periods of neglect.

Requirements:
+ Calendar (Google Calendar)
+ List (Google Tasks)

Instructions:
+ Record all of your to-dos and deadlines on your calendar. This becomes your master schedule.
+ Deal with your calendar once every 24 hours. Take note of new stuff during the day using your list and then add it to the calendar at the end of the day when you plan for the next day.
Tips:
- Be intentional about your time.
+ Don't copy all the stuff in your list to your calendar for the next day all at once, you don't want to overwhelm yourself
+ Try to label each to-do for the day with a specific time during which you're going to complete it. Be honest and reasonable about how long things really take.
+ Batch together similar tasks/errands and try to end your day at an appropriate time.
+ When you're updating your calendar each day, move the stuff you didn't get done on to other days.
+ Shutdown rituals are also important. Take rest and sleep seriously.
+ Try to some larger scale planning on a monthly basis, just to generate a general direction for the month.

For School:
- Take some extra time planning at the beginning of the semester and for things that have regular deadlines, mark them out for a specific time for the entire semester.
- Most of the advice works for a pretty autonomous/controlled schedule.
