## Intro
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The goal is to maximize a cumulative **reward** over time.

## Key Components:
Key components of RL include:
- **Agent**: The decision maker.
- **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with.
- **State (S)**: The current situation the agent is in.
- **Action(A)**: The possible moves the agent can make.
- **Reward(R)**: A numerical value given as feedback.
- **Policy ($\pi$)**: A strategy that defines which action to take in each state.

## Process
1. The agent observes the current state.
2. It selects an action based on its policy
3. The environment responds, providing a new state and a reward.
4. The agent updates its knowledge based on the reward.
5. Repeat 1-4 until a condition is met.
