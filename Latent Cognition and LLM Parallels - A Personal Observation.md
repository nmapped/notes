# Summary
---
While typing in a half-asleep, hypnagogic state, I noticed a shift in how my thoughts emerged. Instead of drawing from structured ideas, my mind began producing words in a more reactive and mechanical sequence. This felt similar to how language models generate text, relying on the immediate past rather than a cohesive internal map. The experience led me to a set of observations and hypotheses about cognition and its overlap with artificial models.

# Observations
---
1. **Loss of Idea-Level Navigation**
   In a normal waking state, I think through interconnected ideas. During this altered state, those conceptual links weakened or vanished. I was no longer pulling from a network of meanings. Instead, I moved from word to word, driven by short-term momentum.

2. **Emergence of Token-Like Continuity**
   The act of typing became automatic. I was not consciously choosing what to say next. Each word felt like it was prompted by the last. There was no sense of planning or structure, only a sequence shaped by local associations.

3. **Reduction of Executive Oversight**
   I was not evaluating my thoughts or organizing them. My attention was passive. The words flowed without supervision. It felt similar to observing an output stream rather than generating one through deliberate effort.

# Hypotheses
---
1. **Cognitive Degradation Mimics LLM Processing**
   In states of fatigue or partial sleep, the brain may lose access to its high-level conceptual framework. It shifts to a reactive, sequential mode that resembles how autoregressive language models operate. Local context takes precedence over global structure.

2. **Human Cognition Uses Ideas as Primary Units**
   Normally, the brain processes information in terms of ideas, not words. These ideas are fluid, context-sensitive, and shaped by internal states. They relate to each other dynamically, rather than through fixed pairings. In contrast, LLMs rely on static token embeddings and fixed learned associations.

3. **Associative Weighting Is State-Dependent**
   Whether one idea triggers another can depend on mood, memory salience, or attention. This variability explains why the same stimulus may evoke different responses at different times. LLMs cannot replicate this because they lack real-time modulation of concept relevance.

# Conclusion
---
This altered cognitive state revealed a fallback mechanism in the human mind that resembles how language models function. When deprived of higher-order processing, the brain can reduce its output to a stream of local associations. This makes LLMs less alien than they seem. They reflect one possible configuration of human thought, but not its default. Full human cognition is built on dynamic, evolving networks of ideas, not token-by-token continuity. That distinction remains critical.
