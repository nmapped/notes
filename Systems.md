# Intro
----
I came across a youtube video by a post-doc I think. The topic of the video was planning and studying like a PhD student. After watching the video for a bit, I realized that she had created really nice and tight systems for self-learning. I pondered for a bit and realized that almost every aspect of my life stands to gain from a formalized system.

> Formalisms are birthed to flesh out intuitions.

A system already exists - a vague understanding of how tasks should be performed, but it's grossly incomplete. It needs structure, it needs rigid definition. Formalize everything: from diet, to study, to relationships, to leisure - formalize everything. Of course the law of diminishing returns still applies although, ideal systems will differ between individuals. Therefore, each individual should know intuitively, where to draw the line. Now, let's take a look at a common avenue to apply structure: study.

# How to Formalize
----
Make no mistake, we are not talking about rules. As I mentioned earlier, systems will differ from person to person so naturally it would be hard to find two people with identical ideal systems. The first step to formalize, is to understand how you operate. What is the best time for you so study, how long can you study at a stretch, what are your goals



- know what you want to achieve
- figure out long and short term goals
- figure out why you're doing what you're doing. write down your motivations
- gather resources
