Machine Learning is the process of enabling computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so. A model is a system that tries to mimic patterns in data to enable these predictions. It is the framework in which the learning takes place. The process of trying to find the patterns is called learning.

Some common types include supervised and unsupervised learning.

Supervised learning algorithms learn to predict outputs from inputs or predict $x$ to $y$ mappings. It involves giving the learning algorithm the right answer $y$ for each example to learn from.

Common supervised learning types include _regression_ and _classification_. Regression involves predicting a single number from infinitely possible numbers while classification involves predicting a small number of possible outputs/categories.

Predicting house prices based on house size is an example of a regression problem. Predicting if a tumor is malignant or benign is an example of a classification problem.

Unsupervised learning requires the algorithm to find patterns in _unlabeled_ data. It is used to find structure in data. The data has inputs $x$ but no $y$.

A type of unsupervised learning is clustering. For example, in Google News, similar news articles are grouped into clusters. Other examples include clustering DNA microarrays and automatic market segmentation.

Other supervised learning algorithms include anomaly detection (used in fraud detection) and dimensionality reduction.
